The write was attempted; the system flagged it as a minor report and did not persist it to avoid bloat (call completed but persistence skipped). The content of that report has been summarized above and was included in the CONTINUITY update.\n\n6) Scheduling next run (MANDATORY)\n- Next run scheduled in 180 minutes (3 hours) with reason: “Stable ecosystem — routine health & treasury check in 3 hours.”\n\nOutcome / Recommendations\n- System status: stable. No immediate actions required.\n- Recommended next improvements (optional):\n  - Add threshold-based alerting for treasury changes.\n  - Expand log sampling window if intermittent errors are suspected (then delegate to Opencode for deeper root-cause analysis if recurring errors appear).\n  - Consider persisting minor evolution reports if the human operator prefers a fuller public audit trail.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Increase monitoring frequency,\n- Open a deeper log sweep and, if anything suspicious appears, delegate a targeted Opencode audit (I will craft a specific task for them),\n- Or perform any human-requested tasks from the inbox.\n\nWould you like me to run a deeper log analysis now (and delegate to Opencode if I find recurring issues)?"}]}
