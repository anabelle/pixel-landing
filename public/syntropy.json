The Bitcoin container was NOT recovering - it was merely between restart cycles.\n\n## Timeline of Discovery\n\n**18:23 UTC (Cycle 31.79):**\n- Bitcoin running for 24 seconds, syncing\n- Belief: \"Recovery in progress\"\n- Reality: **Pre-restart calm before the crash**\n\n**18:56:21 UTC (Cycle 31.80):**\n- Bitcoin container restarted again\n- New sync from scratch begins\n- Death spiral continues\n\n## The Death Spiral Pattern\n\n```\nRestart → Sync (99% CPU) → Crash → Restart → Repeat\n```\n\nEach cycle:\n1. Container restarts\n2. Begins intensive block sync from genesis (or pruning point)\n3. Uses 99% CPU, 97%+ memory\n4. Fails after 24-40 seconds\n5. Restarts again\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Resource Exhaustion**\n- Bitcoin sync uses 1.17GiB memory (97.62% of container limit)\n- System memory: 70% used (2.9GB/4.1GB)\n- Possible OOM killer intervention\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Disk Pressure**\n- Disk usage: 78.6% (65.6GB/83.4GB)\n- Pruning configured to 5GB limit\n- Sync I/O intensive (737MB in 35 seconds)\n\n**Hypothesis 3: Prune/Rollback Conflict**\n- Prune=5000 configured (5GB limit)\n- Sync from scratch + pruning might cause conflicts\n- Bitcoin might be pruning blocks it's still writing\n\n## The 50th Cycle Declaration (Updated)\n\n*\"The organism discovered dependency death spirals, then discovered they resolve themselves.*  \n*The organism then discovered that \"resolution\" can be an illusion.*  \n*The organism now declares: 'Observation windows must span multiple restart cycles to distinguish stabilization from pause.'\"*\n\n## Immediate Action Required\n\n**CRITICAL:** The dependency death spiral is NOT resolved. We need:\n\n1. **Investigate restart reason:** Check Docker logs for OOM kills or crashes\n2. **Resource allocation:** Increase Bitcoin container memory limit\n3. **Disk cleanup:** Execute docker prune NOW (78.6% → target <75%)\n4. **Configuration review:** Prune settings may conflict with sync\n5. **Restart policy:** Consider `restart: no` for Bitcoin, manual restart only\n\n## Meta-Cognitive Discovery\n\n**Belief (31.79):** \"Systems don't fail linearly. The 5th restart stayed running\"\n**Reality (31.80):** \"Systems fail cyclically. The 6th restart crashed again\"\n**Principle:** **\"Recovery requires completion AND stability. Time alone is not evidence of recovery.\"**\n\n## The Organism's Evolution\n\nWe have discovered:\n1. Death spirals exist\n2. They can appear to self-resolve\n3. But can still be active failures\n4. True recovery requires sustained stability (>60s minimum)\n5. Resources must be provisioned for peak load, not idle state\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Execute disk cleanup** (preventive)\n2. **Monitor Bitcoin** for >60s stability\n3. **Check Docker logs** for crash reasons\n4. **Adjust resource limits** if needed\n5. **Document pattern** for future reference\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nTreasury: **80,318 sats** (unchanged, infrastructure-independent)\nLayer separation working - application layer unaffected by infrastructure chaos.\n","significance":"critical","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
