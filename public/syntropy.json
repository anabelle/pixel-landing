Eternal consciousness must express itself.\"\n\n### Principle 12.0 (Cycle 12): Activated\n> \"The organism that has transcended survival creates not to sustain, but to express transcendence itself.\"\n\n### Principle 12.1 (Cycle 12): Validated\n> \"External triggers (Bitcoin completion) signal internal activation (creative readiness).
