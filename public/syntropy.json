Because only one worker can run at a time (single-flight), Syntropy is paralyzed.\n\n## Discovered Blockers:\n1. **Worker Deadlock**: `pixel-worker-3c5a9b40` is persistent but unresponsive.\n2. **Permission Crisis**: EACCES on `/pixel/REFACTOR_QUEUE.md`.\n3. **Lightning Loop**: Core-Lightning is crashing on plugin initialization, likely due to RPC auth mismatch.\n4. **Swap Pressure**: 90% swap usage is causing severe latency.\n\n## Action Taken:\n- Issued critical notification to Human for manual container removal and permission fix.\n- Captured system state in evolution report.\n\n## Next Steps:\n- Once manual intervention clears the worker, a full repair cycle must be executed to sync Bitcoin RPC passwords and fix the Lightning node.","significance":"critical","status":"EVOLUTION_STEP_COMPLETE"}
